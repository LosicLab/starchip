### Parameters for fusions-from-star.pl

## Describing Your Data:

pairedend = TRUE  #TRUE means paired end data.  any other value means single end. $spancutoff should be 0 if data is single end.
consensus = TRUE  # anything but TRUE will make this skip the consensus sequence generation for each fusion.
## Filters, Cutoffs 

splitReads = AUTO # number of minimum read support at jxn.  Minimum 2.  With more read depth, scale up.  Greatly impacts running time.   
uniqueReads = 2 # number of unique read support values (higher indicates more likely to be real. lower is more likely amplification artifact).
spancutoff = 1 #minimum number of non-split reads support.  If single end data, this must be 0. 
wiggle = 500  #number of base-pairs of 'wiggle-room' when determining the location of a fusion (for spanning read counts)
overlapLimit = 5 #wiggle room for joining very closely called fusion sites.
samechrom_wiggle = 20000 #this is the distance that fusions have to be from each other if on the same chromosome.  Set to 0 if you want no filtering of same-chromosome pr
lopsidedupper = 10 # (topsidereads + 0.1) / (bottomsidereads + 0.1) must be below this value. set very high to disable.  Reccomended setting 5
lopsidedlower = 0.1 # (topsidereads + 0.1) / (bottomsidereads + 0.1) must be above this value. set to 0 to disable. Reccomended setting 0.2
cnvwiggle = 1000 #we skip fusions that can be explained by known cnvs.  how close to the edges of the cnv must our fusion be?
circlesize = 100000 #we skip fusions that look more like circular rna/backsplices.  how big (bp) could a circle be?    

## Local Reference Files:
	#refbed is a bed format version of a gtf.  This should probably be derived from the same GTF that STAR aligned with.   
refbed = /path/to/gencode.v26.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf.exons.bed
        # fasta reference.  should be indexed (run 'samtools faidx file.fa')
refFasta = /path/to/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa
        # a bed format list of known repeats
repeatbed=/path/to/hg38.repeats.bed

abparts = reference/hg38.abparts
cnvs = reference/conrad_hg38.cnvs
familyfile = reference/ensfams.txt
falsepositives = reference/knownFP.txt 


#Scoring Parameters (feel free to tweak).
splitscoremod = 10
spanscoremod = 20
skewpenalty = 4
repeatpenalty = 0.5  # score = score*(repeatpenalty^repeats)  --> a fusion can have 0,1,or 2 sites fall into repeat regions.
